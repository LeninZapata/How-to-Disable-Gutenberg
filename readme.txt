Gutenberg is the name of the project to create a new editor experience for WordPress. 
The goal is to create a new post and page editing experience that makes it easy for anyone to create rich post layouts. 
It’s planned to be merged into WordPress core in the version 5.0. 
Gutenberg will changes the way you create content a lot. 

You’ll be able to add complex elements to the post content via blocks. 
They can be images with overlay text or a list of items with thumbnails.
While Gutenberg is a wonderful editor for bloggers or publishing websites (news, media), 
it probably is not a good choice with other WordPress websites. 
WordPress is now much more than a publishing platform. 

It can be a real-estate website where a lot of data for properties. 
It can also be a job board or a forum. In these kinds of websites, using an editor like Gutenberg might be confused and sometimes hard to use. 
So, how to disable Gutenberg? And how to revert back to the WordPress classic editor?
This plugin facilitates it!
